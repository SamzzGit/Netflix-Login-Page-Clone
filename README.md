# Netflix Login Page Clone

A responsive clone of the **Netflix login page** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project replicates the design and layout of the Netflix login screen, featuring a modern interface with a background image, login form, and interactive buttons.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: The page adjusts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using **flexbox** and **media queries**.
- **Login Form**: A basic login form with email and password input fields.
- **Netflix-like UI**: Mimics the style of the official Netflix login page, including background image, buttons, and header elements.
- **Modern CSS techniques**: Uses **flexbox** for layout, **linear gradients** for button styles, and **background images** for a dynamic appearance.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: The page looks good across modern browsers.
